    <h2>Weekly Reflection</h2>
    <h3>What went well</h3>
    <p>This week I managed a fair amount of work and I was proud of that, Simon said my code was well done and showed my love for coding which meant the world to me. Other positive aspects focused on the positive response to my overall design in the pitch process, It meant alot to me to have positive reinforcement despite my having some of the deepest struggles I've experienced this year during this term.</p>
    <h3>What didnâ€™t go well</h3>
    <p>The huge problem I came across was the problem with my code, I had come across two problems, the first being the lack of a responsive design and then the second during my design process, accidentally having the page 100% zoomed out, so I had to bite the bullet on the reponsive design, take the loss and focus on fixing the pimrary problem of fixing the CSS to be a 1000px view port focused design. </p>
    <h3>What can be improved</h3>
    <p>Honestly, A lot could've been Improved on during this process, I allowed myself to spiral during the first weeks process and the continuous rejections, It got to me and then everything went down hill in a way, My health got in the way, then experiencing some pretty serious personal life problems, all of this effected me pretty severely and I struggled to 100% Catch back up from that point onward. On that same note I found simon and others telling me and reminding me how hard I have been on myself during this term, Simon reminded me that my work was great, I just struggled and that of course impacted some of the process but it didnt mean it was the end of the world. From this point, All I can do is learn from these mistakes, go into next time with a fresh mindset, give myself a break and then get into it with the mindset of learning and progressing as a designer rather than focusing on how I may have made mistakes in past projects.
