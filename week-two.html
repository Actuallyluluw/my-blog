    <h2>Daily Reflection</h2>
    <h3>05/05/25</h3>
    <p>What will I do today?</p>
    <p>I focused on a quick breakdown of some java script features, After friday, having my initial idea being shut down, I felt pretty unmotivated, having to go back to the drawing board. At this stage ive focused on looking back at my brainstorm, breaking down the key themes of Interests align, Determined Inappropriate and Saturated space, through process of elimination ending up on artists struggles. At this stage I began the secondary research process.</p>
    <p>Are there any blockers?</p>
    <p>Ive been feeling quite demotivated by the fact im already behind due to denied ideas and it causes a lack of motivation.</p>
    <h3>06/05/25</h3>
    <p>What did I accomplish yesterday? </p>
    <p>Yesterday I managed to establish my new idea and begin gathering recourses and make a start on the secondary research process.</p>
    <p>What will I do today?</p>
    <p>Today I focus on breaking down my personal experiences and assumptions and from that point am able to identify some research problems to further look into to build my understanding of the problems artists face.</p>
    <p>Are there any blockers?</p>
    <p>Blockers are just finding recourses that fit accurately into the theme and identify the key problems artists face.</p>
    <h3>07/04/25</h3>
    <p>What did I accomplish yesterday? </p>
    <p>Yesterday I managed to achieve what I had planned out, and so am set up well to continue into secondary research, seperating it into three different focus topics, Financially instability, Community and Unwelcoming Environments. Then go onto brainstorm the primary research based off of this research and then what they are missing, so that I may identify any opportunities</p>
    <p>What will I do today?</p>
    <p>Today I worked on creating key questions for my primary research, focusing on these, Space & Accessibility, Personal Practice & Creative Process, Support Systems & Resources and Art Scene & Engagement.</p>
    <p>Are there any blockers?</p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>08/05/25</h3>
    <p>What did I accomplish yesterday? </p>
    <p>Yesterday I was able to identify my primary research questions and create a overall layout to clearly display participants answers and experiences.</p>
    <p>What will I do today?</p>
    <p>Today I plan to conduct two planned interviews and search further for more participants, getting a range of artists representation.</p>
    <p>Are there any blockers?</p>
    <p>I dont have direct connection to traditional and digital artists persuing careers, other than fellow graphic designers, however this would not give a realistic and diverse perspective from a range of artists in age, gender, cultural background and creative discipline. From this point i considered melodys previous advice from my pitch presentation, as she showed a lot of personal connections and interest in the topic. </p>
    <h3>09/05/25</h3>
    <p>What did I accomplish yesterday? </p>
    <p>Yesterday I conducted and gathered my first two participant answers and began breaking down their responses and plan out a empathy map.</p>
    <p>What will I do today?</p>
    <p>I was able to identify some places to reach out to to get more artists perspectives through art community groups and created a post to attract interested participants as wells as reaching out to and individual artists that had been featured in events such as the zinefest.</p>
    <p>Are there any blockers?</p>
    <p>At this stage it is just a waiting game for answers to my community posts and hopefully hear back from community pages and individuals. During this blocker, I intend to create personas and target audience based off of the information currently collected as well as breaking down competitor and SWOT analysis to identify opportunities to target for this brief.</p>

    <h2>Weekly Reflection</h2>
    <h3>What went well</h3>
    <p>This week, I feel I was able to create a well-rounded amount of primary and secondary research. I also began the process of competitor analysis, identifying key gaps in the market where our target audience’s needs are not currently being met. Additionally, I started mapping how these insights can inform our design direction, helping to align our concept with both user expectations and business goals. One of the key insights from the current interviews showed that emerging artists expressed a need for inclusive and welcoming environments. This suggests a need for low-pressure, affirming spaces (both physical and digital) that encourage consistent creative practice and community connection without overwhelming users.</p>
    <h3>What didn’t go well</h3>
    <p>This week I definitely felt I hit some hurdles in the process, figuring out where to get informative and valuable secondary research and how to get effective primary research from a range of different artists that give me a well rounded representation in my research and understanding. When gathering research, it was important to find valuable research not just quantative, prioritising intentional outreach to ensure diverse perspectives are represented, especially in creative communities where voices are often underrepresented or hard to reach.</p>
    <h3>What can be improved</h3>
    <p>My research was challenging due to needing a range of voices, primarily due to the research process being delayed because of the backpush from my initial ideas. This delay limited the time available to reach out to a larger and more diverse group of participants and refine my research questions, which affected the depth and of insights I was able to gather.</p>
    <h3>What actions will I take for the next sprint</h3>
    <p>For the next sprint, I intend to go forward into the Lofi-Prototyping phase, establishing the business model concept, user journey and initial testing.</p>
