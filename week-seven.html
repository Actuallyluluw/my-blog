    <h2>Daily Reflection</h2>
    <h3>23/06/25</h3>
    <p>What will I do today?</p>
    <p>Today Im continuing to experiment with my Prototype designs and the assets, its a lot of trial and error at this stage, other than that there isnt much to reflect on.</p>
    <p>Are there any blockers?</p>
    <p>Blockers is just finding the balance in this style, learning how to lay it out in a way thats complimentary and overall just exploring a unfamiliar style of design.</p>
    <h3>24/06/25</h3>
    <p>What did I accomplish yesterday? </p>
    <p>Yesterday I managed to establish a consistent design I was happy with, recieved some peer feedback and made a few changes based on this.</p>
    <p>What will I do today?</p> 
    <p>Today I plan to begin making prototpe pages, experimenting with layout and making more assets.</p>
    <p>Are there any blockers?</p>
    <p>The creation of assets can take a while, its a new medium and takes time to experiment with and figure out patterns of design.</p>
    <h3>25/06/25</h3>
    <p>What did I accomplish yesterday? </p>
    <p>Yesterday I managed to complete a couple of pages of my prototype, with the design elements I created also incorporated into them.</p>
    <p>What will I do today?</p>
    <p>Today I plan to continue working on the prototypes and hopefully be set up to begin coding tomorrow.</p>
    <p>Are there any blockers?</p>
    <p>No blockers, Just feeling tired and overwhelmed by the work load.</p>
    <h3>26/06/25</h3>
    <p>What did I accomplish yesterday? </p>
    <p>Yesterday I continued to work on my prototype, The process has been feeling incredibly slow and stressful, feeling like im falling behind but cant seem to catch up and get into a good work flow. </p>
    <p>What will I do today?</p>
    <p>today I want to explore the possibilities with my digital exhibition Mockup and create a visual for this.</p>
    <p>Are there any blockers?</p>
    <p>Blockers are currently feeling torn on how to design the exhibtion mockup as well as having mockups that seem perfect, then they dont actually function, leaving me at the drawing board. </p>
    <h3>27/05/25</h3>
    <p>What did I accomplish yesterday? </p>
    <p>Yesterday was a lot of trial and error and trying to find mockups and inspiration for my digital exhibition mockup, Despite all this, I'm honestly not entirely happy with the end result currently and hope to go back and alter it.</p>
    <p>What will I do today?</p>
    <p>Today I want to begin to prepare all my assets for my code and begin blocking out the layout and sections of my code.</p>
    <p>Are there any blockers?</p>
    <p>I just feel incredibly stressed, under motivated and the pressure to get it done all at once, making me feel kind of frozen.</p>

    <h2>Weekly Reflection</h2>
    <h3>What went well</h3>
    <p>This week I caught up on my prototype work, and managed to get over the design learning curve during the process</p>
    <h3>What didnâ€™t go well</h3>
    <p>I found myself really struggling to focus and make progress during this week, I started out well but quickly lost momentum in my work process, I think the overwhelming feeling of needing to catch up got to me further.</p>
    <h3>What can be improved</h3>
    <p>I think It mightve been beneficial for me to go onto campus a few days, it wouldve put me more in a working mood and environment, I plan to go onto campus tomorrow and catch up as much as I can and hopefully have my website completed by mid week, allowing room for testing and time to create my presentation and case study.</p>
    <h3>What actions will I take for the next sprint</h3>
    <p>For my next sprint there are a few milestones I have to meet, such as my final presentation, I plan to have my website finished by wednesday hopefully, so I can conduct some user testing and refinement and finish my case study.</p>
