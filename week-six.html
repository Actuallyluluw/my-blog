    <h2>Weekly Reflection</h2>
    <h3>What went well</h3>
    <p>This week, I managed to stay on a fairly consistent timeline, got some good feedback and managed to begin to impliment it well.</p>
    <h3>What didnâ€™t go well</h3>
    <p>I have have found myself behind due to feedback recieved and needing to work around it accordingly to make sure my designs are up to the lecturers expectations, I plan to work on this by catching up as much as possible during week 07 and getting back on track with where I need to be.</p>
    <h3>What can be improved</h3>
    <p>I think Ive had some difficulties feeling frozen with overwhelming feelings and it made my work process be less productive than usual, I think I got in my head more than usual and has been a learning curve to get through.</p>
    <h3>What actions will I take for the next sprint</h3>
    <p>My next steps will be working toward catching up on where I need to be, working on my Hi-fi Prototypes, getting my website done and using the weekend of week 07 to ensure I'm ready for week 08.</p>
