    <h3>09/06/25</h3>
    <p>What will I do today?</p>
    <p>Today Im working on sketching up some drafts for my typeface design, getting a more clear vision of the design and what steps I need to take to digitise this and overall finalise a design.</p>
    <p>Are there any blockers?</p>
    <p>Blockers currently are just feeling incredibly overwhelmed because I have in mind the coding aspects and Im aware its not my strong suit in this assignment.</p>
    <h3>10/06/25</h3>
    <p>What did I accomplish yesterday? </p>
    <p>Yesterday I managed to complete my drafts and initial ideas but had to reimagine my initial idea into something more realistic with our timeframe.</p>
    <p>What will I do today?</p> 
    <p>Today I plan on focusing more on my graphic design assignment, working on beginnign to build a brand guideline and going toward creating a styleguide for my prototypes.</p>
    <p>Are there any blockers?</p>
    <p>No Blockers</p>
    <h3>11/06/25</h3>
    <p>What did I accomplish yesterday? </p>

    <p>No Blockers</p>
    <h3>12/06/25</h3>
    <p>What did I accomplish yesterday? </p>

    <p>What will I do today?</p>
    <p>Today I will look into the code aspects that I'm missing and need for my interactive aspect of my code.</p>
    <p>Are there any blockers?</p>
    <p>Blockers are having this being a learning curve to adapt to and figure out how to make the code functional.</p>
    <h3>13/05/25</h3>

    <h2>Weekly Reflection</h2>
    <h3>What went well</h3>
    <p>This week, I managed to cover the type face assignment quite well, getting it done in a good timeline</p>
    <h3>What didnâ€™t go well</h3>
    <p>Despite having the typeface assignment timeline well done, it meant that alot of my other work for this week was put on the back burner and unfortunately makes me feel incredibly overwhelemed with keeping up with the typeface deadline and my weekly deadline of work to keep on track.</p>
    <h3>What can be improved</h3>
    <p>I think I needed a better balance between both assignments and the typeface assignment threw me off significantly, aswell as having a sort of vague idea of my specific style, its assets and how its applied, makes the stylescape seem unfinished and inconsistent.</p>
    <h3>What actions will I take for the next sprint</h3>
    <p>Possibly reconsidering the brand guidelines, depending on the feedback recieved for the WIP, taking into account their feedback and making sure to be as productive as I can to catch up on the work I fell behind on due to the typeface assignment focus of this week.</p>
