    <h2>Daily Reflection</h2>
    <h3>28/04/25</h3>
    <p>What will I do today?</p>
    <p>Today, I spent time reflecting on the insights shared by our guest speakers about the Type Here competition and brief. I began exploring some initial ideas and took notes on their design processes and what they expect from the brief. We were also introduced to our first formative project—a cupcake website—meant as a quick refresher of our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. I aimed to complete most of it today, using the time to get back into coding and apply what I’ve learned so far.</p>
    <p>Are there any blockers?</p>
    <p>I anticipate some blockers in regards to the formative, as refreshing these skills after a two-week break may be a brief learning curve, and the amount of work expected feels like it may take longer than the suggested three hours.</p>
    <h3>29/04/25</h3>
    <p>What did I accomplish yesterday? </p>
    <p>I managed to complete the majority of the website formative we were given, though it took more time than suggested to reach a level that met the brief and that I was personally satisfied with.</p>
    <p>What will I do today?</p>
    <p>Today, I intend to complete the remainder of the cupcake website. Tuesday’s class focused on a walkthrough of how Simon approached the formative, which I’ll use as a guide while finishing up my own.</p>
    <p>Are there any blockers?</p>
    <p>At this stage, I have some general starting ideas, but I feel I need a clearer understanding of the brief and to explore a wider range of options before finding a direction that aligns with my goals.</p>
    <h3>30/04/25</h3>
    <p>What did I accomplish yesterday? </p>
    <p>Yesterday, I completed and submitted my cupcake site. It was a generally difficult day due to a health appointment, which tend to leave me in a low mental state and definitely disrupted my workflow and motivation.</p>
    <p>What will I do today?</p>
    <p>Today we have a joint lecture, focusing on getting an overall idea of our problem, through activities. The lectures focusing on agile methodolgy and more.</p>
    <p>Are there any blockers?</p>
    <p>At this stage Im approaching ideas and brainstorming the idea of something related to chronic/invisible illnesses after seeing it and using it in the metaphor activity and feeling inspired by my personal experience. </p>
    <h3>01/05/25</h3>
    <p>What did I accomplish yesterday? </p>
    <p>Hello</p>
    <p>What will I do today?</p>
    <p>Hello</p>
    <p>Are there any blockers?</p>
    <p>Hello</p>
    <h3>02/05/25</h3>
    <p>What did I accomplish yesterday? </p>
    <p>Yesterday, I felt incredibly demotivated after having my initial idea rejected, especially after spending the day developing it, leaving me feeling like I was back at square one. </p>
    <p>What will I do today?</p>
    <p>Today was focused on ideation. We took part in an ideation workshop that helped generate inspiration for our Type Now brief. The activities allowed me to develop and refine my ideas, making them more aligned with the brief.  </p>
    <p>Are there any blockers?</p>
    <p>At this stage, I had come up with a new idea in regards to the enterprise breif, hoping it would better align with the brief after my initial concept was declined due to valid ethical concerns. However, I’ve since encountered similar issues with my new idea, which focuses on safety in cities and being street smart. </p>
