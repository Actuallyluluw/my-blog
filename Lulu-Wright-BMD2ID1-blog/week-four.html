    <h2>Daily Reflection</h2>
    <h3>02/06/25</h3>
    <p>What will I do today?</p>
    <p>Today I intend to begin looking into my design direction options, compiling two design direction options so that I can begin to design and create my pitch and design strategy documents</p>
    <p>Are there any blockers?</p>
    <p>No blockers</p>
    <h3>03/06/25</h3>
    <p>What did I accomplish yesterday? </p>
    <p>Yesterday I was able to establish two different design directions and create supporting moodboards, and choosing to focus on my first direction, which focuses on brutalist designs with reds, blacks and whites, Where as my second design direction option is focused on being very colourful and incorporating digital design elements into the design.</p>
    <p>What will I do today?</p>
    <p>Today, now that these design directions are completed I am able to go forward with creating my pitch presentation and its design </p>
    <p>Are there any blockers?</p>
    <p>No blockers</p>
    <h3>04/06/25</h3>
    <p>What did I accomplish yesterday? </p>
    <p>Yesterday I worked on my pitch 1 presenation design, covering all the bases needed and designing it in preperation for today</p>
    <p>What will I do today?</p>
    <p>Today I presented my pitch and recieved valuable feedback to go forward with, The lecturers felt the second choice design direction had more potential and was more unique, opening the door to connect digital and traditional art works together, reflecting the evolving art world. I plan to breakdown the feedback recieved and begin the logo design process now I have a confirmed and informed design direction.</p>
    <p>Are there any blockers?</p>
    <p>No blockers other than creative block</p>
    <h3>05/06/25</h3>
    <p>What did I accomplish yesterday? </p>
    <p>Yesterday I finished some logo brainstorming and plan to transfer some ideas over to digital designs and continue to refine until establishing my final choice.</p>
    <p>What will I do today?</p>
    <p>Today I plan to digitise some of my logo options, specifically into pixel art format, this almost is a secondary part to drafting drawing due to how different the design can look in a pixel art form</p>
    <p>Are there any blockers?</p>
    <p>No Blockers</p>
    <h3>06/06/25</h3>
    <p>What did I accomplish yesterday? </p>
    <p>Yesterday I managed to complete my logo design and begin my design strategy document, meaning that im set up to complete my design strategy document for todays deadline.</p>
    <p>What will I do today?</p>
    <p>Today I plan to complete my design strategy document, working on the remaining slides I need, following what the lecturers had suggested. </p>
    <p>Are there any blockers?</p>
    <p>No Blockers</p>

    <h2>Weekly Reflection</h2>
    <h3>What went well</h3>
    <p>This week was quite productive and I managed to stay well ontrack and meet the deadlines required, aswell as having a positive response to my pitch 01 with helpful feedback that aided in developing the brand design.</p>
    <h3>What didnâ€™t go well</h3>
    <p>Initially I felt quite concerned having my first design direction denied and told to go with my second option, being concerned of how to apply a completely new design direction I've never tried before, but ultimately wrapped my head around it and just dived right in.</p>
    <h3>What can be improved</h3>
    <p>In the future I think I couldve spent more time on the initial assets as there was a small time before creating the pitch then needing to create my design strategy and that caused some lower quality assets and a bit of change in the design causing some lack of consistency.</p>
    <h3>What actions will I take for the next sprint</h3>
    <p>For the next sprint, I will primarily be focusing on getting the type face assigment done</p>
