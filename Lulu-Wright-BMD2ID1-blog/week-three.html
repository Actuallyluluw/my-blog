    <h2>Daily Reflection</h2>
    <h3>26/05/25</h3>
    <p>What will I do today?</p>
    <p>Today, I’m still in recovery from being sick, so my main focus is on resting and getting back to 100%. That said, I plan to make a gentle start on the Business Model Canvas if I’m feeling up to it. </p>
    <p>Are there any blockers?</p>
    <p>Recovering still from being sick is definitely a huge block, especially when all I can realistically do is wait it out.</p>
    <h3>27/05/25</h3>
    <p>What did I accomplish yesterday? </p>
    <p>Yesterday, I made solid progress on my Business Model Canvas, covering key information that will be important in laying the foundation for building my studio.</p>
    <p>What will I do today?</p> 
    <p>Today, I plan to continue working on my Business Model Canvas and aim to have it completed by the end of the day. This will set me up to begin the ideation phase tomorrow, where I’ll focus on identifying the enterprise’s goals and purpose, key content, and core messaging.</p>
    <p>Are there any blockers?</p>
    <p>My main blocker at the moment is still feeling unwell, but things are starting to look up. I’m hopeful that I’ll be back to 100% soon and able to focus on the work</p>
    <h3>28/04/25</h3>
    <p>What did I accomplish yesterday? </p>
    <p>Yesterday, I completed my Business Model Canvas, which helped me gain a clearer understanding of the enterprise’s values, how it operates, and what it offers. It gave me a more structured view of the key activities, customer segments, and value propositions, which will guide my next steps in shaping the brand and refining its purpose.</p>
    <p>What will I do today?</p>
    <p>Today, I’ll be focusing on developing the ideation phase. This will give me the space to explore the goals, purpose, and messaging behind the enterprise, which is essential for establishing the studio’s core values. I’ll be considering both what the studio stands for and how it wants to be perceived, using this as a foundation for building a clear and authentic brand direction.</p>
    <p>Are there any blockers?</p>
    <p>Currently no blockers.</p>
    <h3>29/05/25</h3>
    <p>What did I accomplish yesterday? </p>
    <p>Yesterday, I achieved what I set out to do by finalising key aspects of my concept and structure, which has set me up to begin developing a paper prototype.</p>
    <p>What will I do today?</p>
    <p>Today, my focus is on progressing with the paper prototype. I’m currently a little behind where I’d like to be, so I plan to dedicate some time over the weekend to catch up and ensure I'm back on track for the next stages of development. </p>
    <p>Are there any blockers?</p>
    <p>Currently being behind itself feels like a blocker, it causes a increase of anxiety and overall makes me feel exasperated</p>
    <h3>30/05/25</h3>
    <p>What did I accomplish yesterday? </p>
    <p>Yesterday i managed to do a bulk of the paper prototypes, however I still need to work on more.</p>
    <p>What will I do today?</p>
    <p>Today, I'm hoping to finish off my paper prototypes and start planning out user testing. I’d also like to begin working on wireframes over the weekend so I’m prepared for the next phase heading into week four.</p>
    <p>Are there any blockers?</p>
    <p>My main blockers right now are staying focused and catching up so I can get back on the right track with the project.</p>

    <h2>Weekly Reflection</h2>
    <h3>What went well</h3>
    <p>What went well is that I’ve got a clear idea of the enterprise values, services and how it operates, aswell as my next steps. I’ve made progress with the paper prototypes, and I have a solid plan for moving into wireframes and user testing.</p>
    <h3>What didn’t go well</h3>
    <p>Being sick definitely caused a bit of overlap into this week due to recovering, which caused me to slow down and become a bit behind, which is a fairly significant blocker but one I feel I can handle.</p>
    <h3>What can be improved</h3>
    <p>Going forward I think making a more simple lofi prototype would be beneficial to allow a more blank canvas for advice and feedback based on user testing aswell as allowing some room for different design direction options and how they may alter the design.</p>
    <h3>What actions will I take for the next sprint</h3>
    <p>For my next sprint, since we are going into design direction, I think all I can focus on is ensuring Im pushing out good work at a pace where im still able to catch up as much as I can.</p>
